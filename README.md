# Joshua Tree Facts

A quick TailwindCSS refresher project inspired by [makenagolfandbeachclub.com](https://makenagolfandbeachclub.com/)

## Why I Built This

I built this site mainly to brush up on Tailwind and learn the basics of its config file
<br><br>

## Goals

- Practice Tailwind
- Explore Tailwind config file
- Use Vite for a React project
- Incorporate accessibility best practices (semantic HTML, image naming convention, alt text)
  <br><br>

## Technologies Used

- React
- TailwindCSS
- Vite
  <br><br>

## Stretch Goals

- Optimize images and loading
  <br><br>
